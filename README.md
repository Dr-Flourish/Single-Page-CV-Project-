# Single-Page HTML CV

This is a simple CV (Curriculum Vitae) made using only one HTML file.  
The goal of the project was to practice writing clean and meaningful HTML.

## What This Project Includes

- A single HTML page
- Normal CV sections: **Education**, **Skills**, and **Career History**
- Semantic HTML tags (like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`)
- SEO meta tags in the `<head>`
- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- A favicon (small icon in the browser tab)

## How to Open the Project

There are **no installations needed**.  
Just follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the folder
3. Double-click `index.html`
4. The page will open in your web browser

That's all you need to run it.
